# Bloom Filters!

I was inspired by Jamie Talbot's article ["What are Bloom
Filters?"](https://medium.com/the-story/what-are-bloom-filters-1ec2a50c68ff)
and decided to try my hand at implementing the basic algorithm and hopefully
some of the more exciting
[variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter#Extensions_and_applications)
in javascript. Maybe I'll even manage to use some TypedArrays!
